<ul>
  <li>Performed Multi Class Semantic Segmentation on Human Face Dataset(Lapa Dataset)</li>
  <li>Implemented UNet and Depth Residual Seperable UNet Architecture from the research paper and compared performance</li> 
  <li>Created script for real-time face parsing/face segmentation with dynamic quantization on nn.Conv2d, nn.ReLU, nn.ConvTranspose2d, reducing model size and inference latency </li>
  <li>Trained by minimizing hybrid loss function comprising BCE Loss and Dice Coefficient Loss using Adam Optim with Cosine Annealing LR Scheduler</li> 
  <li>Check out the results generated by UNet and Depth Residual Seperable UNet</li>
</ul>
