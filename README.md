# Multi-Class-Image-Segmentation
<ul>
  <li>Performed Multi Class Semantic Segmentation on Human Face Dataset(CelebAMask & LAPA)</li>
  <li>Developed UNet Architecture from research paper and trained from scratch using Adam Optim with Cosine Annealing LR Scheduler</li>
  <li>Developed script for real-time face parsing/face segmentation with dynamic quantization to reduce model size and latency
  <li>Yet to explore: Segment Anything Model(Sam) by Meta AI, Depth Residual UNet, Dice Coefficient Loss, Jaccard's IOU Loss, Tversky Loss, and a couple of other loss functions</li>
</ul>
